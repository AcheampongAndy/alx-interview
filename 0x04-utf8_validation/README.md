# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on validating UTF-8 encoding using Python. The goal is to determine whether a dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding by applying bitwise operations and understanding the UTF-8 encoding scheme.

### Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.4.3
- **Code Style**: PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
- **File Standards**:
  - All files must end with a newline.
  - First line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - A `README.md` file in the projectâ€™s root folder is mandatory.
  - All files must be executable.

### Concepts Utilized
1. **Bitwise Operations in Python**:
   - Using AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), left-shift (`<<`), and right-shift (`>>`).
2. **UTF-8 Encoding Scheme**:
   - Understanding UTF-8 encoding rules and character patterns.
3. **Data Representation**:
   - Handling byte-level data, working with least significant bits.
4. **List Manipulation**:
   - Iterating through lists, accessing elements, and using list comprehensions.
5. **Boolean Logic**:
   - Applying logical operations for program decision-making.
