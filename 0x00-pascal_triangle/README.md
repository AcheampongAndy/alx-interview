# Pascal's Triangle Project

## Overview
This project involves implementing **Pascal's Triangle** in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It is a classical algorithm problem that tests your knowledge of list manipulation, loops, and arithmetic operations in Python.

## Objectives
- Implement a function to generate Pascal's Triangle.
- Use lists and list comprehensions to create and manipulate the triangle.
- Apply loops and conditional logic to ensure accurate calculations.
- Develop an understanding of computational efficiency when generating large triangles.

## Key Python Concepts

### Lists and List Comprehensions:
- Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
- Utilize list comprehensions for concise and readable code.

### Functions:
- Define and use functions to return a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle.

### Loops:
- Use loops to generate each row by summing values from the previous row.

### Conditional Statements:
- Apply conditions to determine values at the edges of the triangle, which are always `1`.

### Indexing and Slicing:
- Access specific elements within lists to calculate new values.

## Additional Topics

### Recursion (Optional):
- While not necessary, recursion provides an alternative way to generate Pascal's Triangle.

### Error Handling (Optional):
- Handle invalid input values such as non-integer or negative numbers using appropriate checks.

## Usage
To use the Pascal Triangle implementation, run the Python script after cloning the repository. The function `pascal_triangle(n)` takes an integer input `n` and returns a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle with `n` rows.

### Example:
```bash
python3 0-main.py
