# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project focuses on implementing an **in-place algorithm** to rotate a given `n x n` 2D matrix by **90 degrees clockwise**. It challenges your understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python, helping to improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand how 2D matrices are represented and manipulated in Python.
- Learn to perform in-place operations to minimize space complexity.
- Implement matrix transposition and row reversal as part of the rotation process.
- Use nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures effectively.

## Key Concepts
1. **Matrix Representation in Python**:
   - Use lists of lists to represent a 2D matrix.
   - Access and modify elements using indices.

2. **In-place Operations**:
   - Modify the original matrix without creating a copy.
   - Optimize for space complexity.

3. **Matrix Transposition**:
   - Swap rows and columns to transpose the matrix.
   - Example: Element at `[i][j]` becomes `[j][i]`.

4. **Reversing Rows**:
   - Reverse the order of elements in each row to complete the rotation.

5. **Nested Loops**:
   - Use nested loops to traverse and modify matrix elements.
