# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Project Overview
In this project, you will use JavaScript to interact with the **Star Wars API** and retrieve a list of character names based on a movie ID provided as a command-line argument. This project will develop your skills in working with external APIs, handling asynchronous requests, and managing data in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
To complete this project successfully, you should understand the following key concepts:

- **HTTP Requests in JavaScript**: Learn how to make requests to external APIs using the `request` module or `fetch` in Node.js.
- **Working with APIs**: Know how to interact with RESTful APIs, parse JSON data, and process API responses.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Manage asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.
- **Command Line Arguments in Node.js**: Use `process.argv` to handle arguments passed to your script.
- **Array Manipulation and Iteration**: Work with JavaScript array methods to manipulate data structures and format output.

## Requirements

### General Requirements
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter**: Your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 10.14.x).
- **File Formatting**:
  - End all files with a new line.
  - Begin each file with `#!/usr/bin/node`.
  - Follow **semistandard** coding style (Standard + semicolons). AirBnB style reference.
- **Execution**: All files must be executable.
- **Variables**: Avoid using `var` (use `let` or `const` instead).
- **File Length**: File length will be tested with the `wc` command.
