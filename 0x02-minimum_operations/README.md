# Minimum Operations

## Project Overview

The "Minimum Operations" project aims to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a target number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. This problem involves a combination of algorithmic concepts such as dynamic programming, prime factorization, and greedy algorithms.

## Problem Description

Given a target number `n`, you need to determine the least number of operations to reach exactly `n` characters. The allowed operations are:

1. **Copy All**: This operation copies all characters currently present.
2. **Paste**: This operation pastes the copied characters.

## Concepts and Techniques

To solve this problem efficiently, you will need to understand and apply the following concepts:

- **Dynamic Programming**: Break down the problem into simpler subproblems and build the solution progressively.
- **Prime Factorization**: Find the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n` to simplify the operations needed.
- **Code Optimization**: Optimize your approach to ensure efficient execution.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Consider a greedy approach by choosing the best option at each step.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Familiarity with loops, conditionals, and functions in Python is essential for implementation.
