# 0x05. N Queens

## Overview
The **N Queens problem** is a well-known puzzle in computer science and mathematics. The objective is to position N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. Solving this requires applying a backtracking algorithm to explore and validate queen placements. This project helps strengthen skills in algorithmic thinking, recursion, and problem-solving.

## Concepts Needed
To complete this project, familiarity with the following concepts is essential:

- **Backtracking Algorithms**:
  - Understand how backtracking algorithms explore potential solutions and reverse steps when encountering dead-ends.

- **Recursion**:
  - Use recursive functions to facilitate backtracking algorithms.

- **List Manipulations in Python**:
  - Manage lists effectively, especially to store queen positions.

- **Python Command Line Arguments**:
  - Handle command-line arguments with the `sys` module.
